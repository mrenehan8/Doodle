# Doodle

This read me will describe how to use the program. 
The program has a white box that represents the canvas. A user can draw in this white box simply by using their fingers. The default color is red but this can be changed by using the spinner set right below the canvas that as a list of color options that are available to use for the drawing.

Below the color option is a slider that controls the Opacity (Transparency) of the drawings. 0 stands for more transparent while 255 stands for non transparent. Although the slider looks as if it starts at 0, the default transparency is 255 but once you move the bar at all, opacity will change accurately. 

Below the Opacity slider is another slider that is associated with the brush size. The more left you go the smaller the brush size will be while the more right you go the larger the brush size will be. 

Lastly there are 3 buttons on the bottom. One of these buttons clears the screen of all drawings, the next will undo drawings that have been made, and the last will redo drawings that have been undone. 

This demonstrates how to use this app correctly. 

I did not use any specific sources to borrow code from or any distinct libraries outside of the Android standard libraries, but I did occassionaly look at the Android API just to see examples on how to properly use certain views such as the Spinner and SeekBars and to see what methods these views had.
